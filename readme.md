Demos showcasing the capabilities of the Framework for Open Ray Tracing Prototyping *foray*

# Examples
## [GBuffer](./examples/gbuffer/)
![GBufferImg](./images/GBuffer.png)
* Demonstrates the outputs provided by the GBuffer (Worldspace position & normals, albedo, motion vectors, material indices, mesh instance indices, depth)
* Additionally showcased functions:
    * Comparer Stage (Module for comparing two images side by side)
    * ImGui Stage (Module for [DearImgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) integration)
## [Minimal Ray tracer](./examples/minimal-raytracer/)
* Demonstrates a minimalist raytracing setup
